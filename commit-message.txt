Complete rewrite: Production-ready outbound firewall with GUI and Debian packaging

This is a complete rewrite of Douane Firewall from scratch, transforming it from
a prototype into a production-ready Linux outbound firewall with proper packaging,
GUI, and system integration.

ARCHITECTURE CHANGES:
- Redesigned to two-process architecture for proper privilege separation:
  * douane-daemon.py: Root process for packet interception and firewall management
  * douane-gui-client.py: User process for GUI dialogs and system tray
  * Communication via Unix socket (/tmp/douane-daemon.sock)
- Separated concerns: firewall_core.py, service_whitelist.py, douane_gui_improved.py

CORE FEATURES:
- NetfilterQueue-based packet interception in userspace
- Per-application + port firewall rules (e.g., Firefox:443 allows all HTTPS)
- Smart whitelist for essential system services (DNS, NTP, DHCP, apt)
- Localhost connections auto-allowed
- Two operating modes:
  * Learning mode: Shows popups, always allows (safe for testing)
  * Enforcement mode: Actually blocks based on decisions
- Persistent rule storage in /etc/douane/rules.json
- UFW integration for permanent firewall rules
- Automatic cleanup of iptables rules on stop

GUI IMPROVEMENTS:
- Modern, enhanced popup dialogs with:
  * Reverse DNS lookup (shows hostname instead of just IP)
  * Port descriptions (e.g., "443 - HTTPS (Secure Web)")
  * Process information (PID, user, CPU%, memory%)
  * Risk assessment (low/medium/high with color indicators)
  * Three-button interface: Allow Once, Allow Always, Deny
  * Auto-deny timeout (30 seconds default)
  * Keyboard shortcuts (Enter/A/Esc)
- System tray icon support (requires pystray and AppIndicator3)
- Window size: 900x750 for full visibility

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Rate limiting: Same app+port won't show popup within 5 seconds
- Pending request tracking to avoid duplicate popups
- In learning mode: Notifications sent but packets immediately allowed (no blocking)
- Decision caching: First popup per app+port, then cached

DEBIAN PACKAGING:
- Complete .deb package structure in debian/
- Polkit policy for GUI password prompts (pkexec)
- Desktop file for application menu integration
- Post-install script handles dependencies and UFW setup
- Post-remove script for clean uninstallation
- Does NOT auto-start on installation (user must launch manually)

INSTALLATION & DEPLOYMENT:
- Build script: build_deb.sh
- Package installs to:
  * /usr/local/bin/douane-daemon
  * /usr/local/bin/douane-gui-client
  * /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/douane/
  * /etc/douane/config.json
  * /usr/share/applications/douane-firewall.desktop
- Dependencies auto-installed: psutil, tabulate, NetfilterQueue, scapy, pystray, pillow
- System dependency: gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1

SAFETY FEATURES:
- Graceful shutdown with signal handlers (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- Automatic iptables cleanup on exit
- Learning mode prevents accidental network lockout
- Localhost always allowed
- Essential services whitelisted
- Error handling defaults to allow (fail-open)

DOCUMENTATION:
- INSTALLATION.md: Complete installation guide
- PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md: Production deployment guide
- CLEAN_START_STOP.md: Safe start/stop procedures
- Updated README.md with current architecture

REMOVED:
- Old prototype files (douane_daemon.py, douane_gui.py, douane_cli.py)
- Demo files and test scripts
- Old installation scripts
- Outdated documentation (EXAMPLES.md, INSTALL.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Cache key format: {app_path}:{dest_port} (per-application + port)
- UFW rules: Allow/deny outgoing on specific port with app comment
- Socket permissions: 0666 (world-readable/writable)
- Log file: /var/log/douane-daemon.log
- Config file: /etc/douane/config.json
- Rules file: /etc/douane/rules.json

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
- System tray icon may not appear on all desktop environments
- UFW rules are per-port, not per-application (daemon enforces per-app)
- Requires root privileges for packet interception
- Only works with iptables-based systems (not nftables)

This version is ready for production use with proper packaging, installation,
and uninstallation procedures.
