# Release Notes

## v2.0.9 - Universal Support & Decoupled Architecture
**Release Date:** 2025-12-20

### 🌍 Universal Linux Support
- **Decoupled Architecture**: Douane no longer messes with your system firewall rules.
- **Pass-Through Logic**: UFW/Firewalld are set to "Allow Outbound", and Douane handles filtering internally via NFQUEUE.
- **Multi-Distro Support**: Added installation scripts and docs for Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, and Arch Linux.
- **RPM Packaging**: Added `build_rpm.sh` and `douane.spec` used by CI/CD.

### 🐛 Improvements & Fixes
- **Instant Reload**: Daemon now reloads configuration instantly on SIGHUP (no restart).
- **Tray Icon**: Fixed tray icon support for modern GNOME/Zorin OS (AppIndicator3).
- **Setup Script**: `setup_firewall.sh` now auto-detects UFW, Firewalld, or raw iptables.

#### Automatic Rule Reload (SIGHUP)
- **Instant rule updates** without restarting the daemon

- Daemon reloads rules from disk when receiving SIGHUP signal
- Control panel automatically sends SIGHUP after:
  - Deleting a rule
  - Clearing all rules
  - Saving configuration changes
- Logs show: "Reloading rules from disk..." and "Rules reloaded: X → Y rules"

#### pkexec Integration
- **Proper permission handling** for editing root-owned files
- Control panel uses **pkexec** (GUI password dialog) instead of sudo
- Secure temporary file approach:
  1. Write changes to temp file
  2. Use `pkexec cp` to copy to `/etc/douane/`
  3. Clean up temp file
- Applies to:
  - Deleting rules
  - Clearing all rules
  - Saving configuration (mode, timeout)
- User sees familiar GUI password prompt (not terminal)

#### AppStream Metadata

  - Categories (System, Security, Network)
  - Content rating (OARS 1.1)
- Searchable with: `appstreamcli search douane`

### 🔧 Improvements

#### Control Panel Enhancements
- **Stays open** when stopping/restarting firewall (no more closing)
- **Real-time status updates** after operations
- **Better error handling** with informative messages
- **Centered dialogs** for better UX
- **Modal dialogs** with `grab_set()` for focus management

#### Installation Experience
- **No more silent installs** - interactive prompts guide users
- **Clear mode explanations** with bullet points
- **Recommended options** clearly marked
- **Fresh install detection** - only prompts on new installations
- **config.json created during install** with user choices

#### Daemon Improvements
- **Signal handlers** for graceful shutdown and reload:
  - SIGHUP: Reload rules from disk
  - SIGTERM: Graceful shutdown
  - SIGINT: Graceful shutdown
- **NFQUEUE watchdog** - Monitors and auto-recovers NFQUEUE rule:
  - Checks every 30 seconds if NFQUEUE rule exists
  - Automatically re-adds rule if missing (e.g., after UFW reload)
  - Logs warnings and recovery actions
- **Better logging** for rule reload operations
- **Rule count tracking** in logs (old count → new count)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed permission errors when deleting rules (now uses pkexec)
- Fixed control panel closing when stopping firewall
- Fixed rules not taking effect after deletion (now sends SIGHUP)
- Fixed confusing installation dialog buttons (now descriptive)
- Fixed missing AppStream metadata (now shows in Software Center)
- Fixed config.json being included in package (now created by postinst)

### 📚 Documentation Updates

- Updated README.md with new features

  - Permission errors in control panel
  - UFW reload removing NFQUEUE rule

### 🔄 Migration Notes

If upgrading from v1.x:

1. **Backup your rules**: `sudo cp /etc/douane/rules.json ~/rules.json.backup`
2. **Uninstall old version**: `sudo dpkg -r douane-firewall`
3. **Install new version**: `sudo dpkg -i douane-firewall_2.0.0_all.deb`
4. **Restore rules if needed**: `sudo cp ~/rules.json.backup /etc/douane/rules.json`
5. **Restart firewall**: Use control panel or `pkill -HUP -f douane-daemon`

### ⚠️ Known Issues

- ~~**NFQUEUE rule can disappear** if UFW is reloaded~~ **FIXED**
