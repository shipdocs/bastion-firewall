Description: High-Performance Application Firewall with eBPF
 Bastion Firewall v2.0 is an advanced outbound application firewall built for
 Zorin OS 18 and compatible Debian-based distributions. This version features
 a high-performance Rust daemon with eBPF for kernel-level process tracking.
 .
 Key Features:
  - Rust daemon for memory-safe, high-performance packet processing
  - eBPF process tracking with <1µs latency
  - Solves timing issues with short-lived connections (curl, wget, etc.)
  - /proc scanning fallback for maximum compatibility
  - Beautiful Qt6 GUI with instant popups
  - System tray icon with visual status
  - Per-application rules with persistent storage
  - Learning mode for easy initial setup
  - UFW integration for inbound protection
  - Bypass rules for system traffic stability
 .
 The Rust daemon uses kernel-level eBPF hooks to capture process information
 at connection creation time, eliminating the race condition that affects
 traditional /proc-based identification methods.
 .
 Requires: Linux kernel 6.0+ with BTF support for eBPF (kernel 5.8+ minimum)
