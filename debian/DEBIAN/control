 system's network connections.

  - Real-time packet interception using netfilter
  - Beautiful GUI dialogs for permission requests
  - Independent tray icon with visual status indicators

  - Per-application, per-port rules

  - Control panel for managing settings and rules

 .
 The installer will guide you through the setup process and can automatically
 configure UFW and start the firewall service.
